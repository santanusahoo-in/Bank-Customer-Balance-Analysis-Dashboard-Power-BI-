## üîç Summary  
This project focuses on understanding customer banking behavior through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  
It analyzes how **demographics**, **education**, **job classification**, and **state location** influence total bank balances.  

The dashboard delivers a comprehensive overview of key indicators such as:  
- Total, Male, and Female Balances  
- Renter vs. Homeowner Balances  
- Job and Education Class Breakdown  
- Monthly Balance Trends  

By visualizing these aspects, this report empowers banks to make data-driven decisions that improve **customer targeting**, **loan strategies**, and **retention planning**.

## üß© Business Problem  
Banks store large volumes of customer and transaction data, but the challenge lies in converting it into actionable insights.  
Without a clear analysis framework, it‚Äôs difficult to answer questions like:  
- Which state or customer group contributes the most to total balance?  
- How do job type and education affect savings or loan balances?  
- When are customers most financially active throughout the year?  

This lack of visibility limits strategic growth opportunities and weakens customer relationship management.

## üéØ Objectives  
The goal of this project is to **visualize and interpret customer balance trends** to aid smarter business decisions.  

**Key objectives include:**  
1. Identify which **states** and **customer segments** contribute most to total balances.  
2. Compare **male vs. female** and **renter vs. homeowner** financial trends.  
3. Examine how **education** and **job classification** impact total balances.  
4. Track **month-by-month changes** in total balance and identify peak performance months.  
5. Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that simplifies exploration of banking data.
